 2023 MegaHack Submission

This project went really well. Machine Learning was a huge step in the success of the project. Next time, I hope to use a supervised model instead of unsupervised, as it great help the results of the healthinesss score since the score is based of real data examples that would be used to train my script. Then, with the firebase client and Express.JS, I was able to connect the machine learning results with the frontend. Our frontend took a lot of time to make because css can be really anoying... But overall, a success. Processing 197k water sites all over the U.S takes time, more than how much time the hackathon gives us. So, we were only able to cover a 50 mile radius from the Lawrenceville School, NJ, to serve as a proof of concept. 

#Next Steps
To add on to this project, I'd like to add a voting system for the community to have their say on the water quality at various water sites. Because, as seen in my code, unsupervised learning isnt always right. With the community's data, we will be able to hyperconfigure our machine learning model, and produce better results. Then, we will aim to provide information for all over the world!
